# Convulation_Neural_Network

The report is based on a classification of the Fashion MNIST dataset available on the Kaggle competition. The dataset is consists of a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is a 28x28 (784 pixels) grayscale image, associated with a label from 5 classes(the only difference between the original dataset & the dataset used in this report). This question deals with the classification of the dataset using a convolutional neural network architecture.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is the most popular neural network model being used for image classification problem.
